## Quick Start

**1. Install**

```bash
npx moodle-mcp
```

Or install globally:
```bash
npm install -g moodle-mcp
```

**2. Get your token** → [see below](#getting-your-token)

**3. Add to your MCP client**

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on Mac, `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moodle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["moodle-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MOODLE_URL": "https://moodle.yourschool.edu",
        "MOODLE_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code** (add to `.vscode/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "moodle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["moodle-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MOODLE_URL": "https://moodle.yourschool.edu",
        "MOODLE_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Your Token

### Option A — Moodle profile page (works everywhere)

1. Log in to your school's Moodle in a browser
2. Go to **Profile → Security keys** (URL: `https://moodle.yourschool.edu/user/managetoken.php`)
3. Find the **Moodle mobile web service** token and copy it
4. Set `MOODLE_TOKEN=<token>` in your MCP config

### Option B — Username + password (not SSO schools)

If your school uses a regular username/password (not Microsoft/Google/SSO), you can skip the token step entirely:

```json
"env": {
  "MOODLE_URL": "https://moodle.yourschool.edu",
  "MOODLE_USERNAME": "your_username",
  "MOODLE_PASSWORD": "your_password"
}
```

> ⚠️ **SSO schools**: If your school login page redirects to Microsoft, Google, or another identity provider, Option B won't work. Use Option A or C.

### Option C — Extract from Moodle mobile app (SSO schools)

1. Install the **Moodle app** on your phone and log in with SSO
2. Go to **App settings → About**
3. Tap the version number 5 times to enable developer mode
4. Go to **Developer options → Copy token** and copy it
5. Use that token as `MOODLE_TOKEN` in Option A

## Obsidian Finals Prep

> Turn your entire semester into a linked knowledge graph in one command.

### Setup

1. **Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** (free, works on Mac/Windows/Linux)
2. Create a new vault, e.g. `~/obsidian/finals`
3. Make sure `moodle-mcp` is connected to your MCP client

### Build the vault

Use the `/build-study-notes` prompt in Claude Desktop:

```
/build-study-notes courseId=42 vaultPath=~/obsidian/finals
```

Or paste this directly into Claude:

```
Pull my [Course Name] (course ID 42), read all the lecture notes and slides,
and build a linked Obsidian vault at ~/obsidian/finals — one note per topic,
with [[wikilinks]] between related concepts, a MOC.md index, and tags for each section.
```

Claude will:
1. Pull all your course sections, files, assignments, and grades
2. Read each PDF and document directly via the MCP resources protocol
3. Write one `.md` file per section with key concepts, definitions, and examples
4. Add `[[wikilinks]]` between related terms across notes
5. Create a `MOC.md` (Map of Content) index linking everything

### See the graph

1. Open the vault in Obsidian
2. Click **Graph View** (sidebar icon or `Cmd+G`)
3. Your entire course appears as a knowledge graph — linked concepts cluster together, isolated topics stand out as things to review

### Natural language search

Once the vault is built, you can ask Claude to find specific content:

```
/search-notes courseId=42 query="the central limit theorem and when to use it"
```

Claude will look through all your course materials, find the relevant files, read them, and synthesize a direct answer.

## Compatibility

Some tools require your Moodle admin to enable specific web services. Run `moodle_get_site_info` to see which tools are available on your school's Moodle.

| Tool | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `moodle_list_courses`, `moodle_get_course`, `moodle_list_resources` | Always available | Core Moodle WS |
| `moodle_list_assignments`, `moodle_get_assignment` | Admin must enable | `mod_assign` service |
| `moodle_get_grades` | Admin must enable | `gradereport_user` service |
| `moodle_get_calendar_events` | Usually available | `core_calendar` service |
| `moodle_list_quizzes`, `moodle_get_quiz_attempts` | Admin may need to enable | `mod_quiz` service |
| `moodle_get_forum_discussions` | Admin may need to enable | `mod_forum` service |
| `moodle_get_notifications` | Admin may need to enable | `message_popup` service |

If a tool isn't available, it returns a helpful message explaining what your admin needs to enable — it won't crash the server.
